Hey guys, this is the DEMO website for end of december :)

IMPORTANT:
Relative paths are different in OSX and windows, this may cause problems. I coded this on 
windows, so if you use mac or linux you have to change the source links to css, image, and
javascript files. You do this by changing all backward slashes in the link \ to forward
slash /, look at the code for more details, comments are provided to guide you.

TO DO:
- information content of infoscreen (questions, article database)
- mock database/backend with question name and description (also necessary for convincing
content of info screen and useful implementation of drag/drop and list change of questions)
- question will appear in specified list when exiting workspace through 'ready for now' button

MAYBE Implement:
- maybe use drag and drop functionality on home screen
- maybe add a user profile page?
