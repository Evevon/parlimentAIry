Hey guys, the demo site already uses some javascript for the button functionality (to have popups appear), so these buttons don't work if you just open the files in the browser. You can use a devserver to run them instead for now. I personally use the devserver from this website: https://www.easyphp.org/ it's easy to install and use (I managed to, so it's easy ;) )


TO DO:
- popup for when leaving the workspace (code already exists, re-use what is used on the index.html page buttons)
- content of the info screen in its entirety (currently using frameset, so can be achieved with simple links to html pages)

MAYBE Implement:
- maybe use drag and drop functionality on home screen
- maybe add a user profile page?
