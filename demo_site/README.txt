Hey guys, this is the DEMO website for end of december :) Website contains php code, so you will
need a devserver in order to run the website. I use the one from https://www.easyphp.org/ .
The devserver and thus the mysql database are local host, so you will need to recreate the 
database tables in phpMyAdmin. The sql code to create it is in the misc folder, and follow this

IMPORTANT:
Relative paths are different in OSX and windows, this may cause problems. I coded this on 
windows, so if you use mac or linux you have to change the source links to css, image, and
javascript files. You do this by changing all backward slashes in the link \ to forward
slash /, look at the code for more details, comments are provided to guide you.

TO DO:
- information content of infoscreen (questions, article database)

MAYBE Implement:
- maybe use drag and drop functionality on home screen
- maybe add a user profile page?
