This django app will be the actual website project.


TO DO:
- info screen functionality
- - look for DMS for the question documents

- IR / datascience stuff when selecting a question to edit. This info
  can be passed through the edit view context in q_answering/views.py.

- add security to the pdf creation process
- - pdf iframe display: disable the use of html tags and javascript
- - think of a smart way to store question answer data to the database ( no direct storage of the user input: maybe file links? maybe DMS?)
